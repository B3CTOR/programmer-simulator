## General info

This is a clicker game programmed in Python 3.9 with the free and open source engine Ursina. In the assets directory you will find the source files of the textures and the sounds so you can modify them.

You will be a programmer that is earning money typing on the keyboard. To type click wherever on the screen. You can buy upgrades that increment the earned money per click. You can buy either an automatic click mode.
